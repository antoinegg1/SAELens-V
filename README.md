# SAE Lens-V

This repository is dedicated to training and analyzing sparse autoencoders (SAE). Building on [SAE Lens](https://github.com/jbloomAus/SAELens), we developed SAE-V to facilitate training multi-modal models, such as Llava-Mistral7b. Additionally, we created a series of scripts that use SAE-V to support mechanistic interpretability analysis in multi-modal models.
